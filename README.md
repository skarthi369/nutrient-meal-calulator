This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project

# DiabetesCare: Tamil Nadu Food Guide

## Project Abstract

DiabetesCare is an innovative mobile application that combines artificial intelligence with cultural sensitivity to help diabetic patients in Tamil Nadu manage their diet effectively. The application addresses a critical healthcare challenge: maintaining traditional dietary preferences while managing diabetes.

### Core Innovation

The application leverages advanced AI technology (Google's Gemini Pro Vision) to analyze food images in real-time, providing:
1. Accurate nutritional information
2. Glycemic index values
3. Culturally appropriate food alternatives
4. Personalized dietary recommendations

### Technical Implementation

Built using React Native and Expo, the application features:
- Real-time image analysis
- Personalized user profiles
- Local data persistence
- Offline capabilities
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Impact

The project aims to:
- Improve diabetes management through informed food choices
- Preserve cultural food traditions while promoting health
- Provide accessible dietary guidance
- Bridge the gap between modern healthcare and traditional cuisine

### Target Users

- Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients
- Pre-diabetic individuals
- Healthcare providers
- Nutritionists specializing in Tamil Nadu cuisine

### Unique Value Proposition

1. Cultural Integration
   - Focuses specifically on Tamil Nadu cuisine
   - Maintains cultural food preferences
   - Provides region-specific alternatives

2. Personalization
   - Adapts to individual diabetes types
   - Considers dietary restrictions
   - Remembers user preferences

3. Accessibility
   - User-friendly interface
   - No internet required for basic functions
   - Available in multiple languages (planned)

### Future Scope

The project roadmap includes:
- Integration with healthcare providers
- Community features for recipe sharing
- Machine learning improvements for more accurate analysis
- Extended regional cuisine support 

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
